This is an app that creates, reads, updates and deletes category and item information from a database and displays
the information in a browser. The app also:
1. Implements a JSON endpoint for the catalog, a category, and an item.
2. Implements Google signin
3. Considers authorization prior to create, update, and delete operations.
4. Shows a login or logout button depending on if a user is signed in or not.
